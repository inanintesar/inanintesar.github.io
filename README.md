# Ways on presenting your Resume on GitHub Pages
Students or anyone who is clueless about Markdown or GitHub and has zero
knowledge regarding the title, therefore my entire assignment is a great help
for them. The way I have hosted my assignment on GitHub pages does a basic
overview of how the document needs to be portrayed for relevant understand and
how it should be done to host any write-up.

# Heading Forward
Like any other signing up process GitHub also follows the same steps. At the
very beginning a GitHub account needs to be created by your desirable email
address making it more convenient by editing it with your own username and
securing it will strong password to avoid any sort of hacking. It is as simple
as downloading any software on your desktop so do the same by downloading GitHub
desktop on your device such as laptop or desktop and easily sign up on GitHub.
To get working on GitHub it has been suggested by my instructor as well as other
reasonable sources to first get your hands on a good resume. Adding on it has
also been specified that the resume needs to be written by using Markdown along
with the help of an editor. While choosing an editor Atom is my priority as it
blends along smoothly with GitHub as well as contains neat live preview features
making my work simpler and makes it more visible that my code is reaching along
resulting to be more accommodating. After getting down with all the downloading
and installation of Atom and GitHub on your desirable devices the next critical
step is to learn Markdown. At the end you will be set to host your resume on
GitHub once Markdown is on your palms.

# Building a Repository
Repository is basic option we get once we sign in on our GitHub desktop and
instructs us to create a repository. Like we do to any of our downloaded
documents in our pc we name the file and same goes for a repository where you
enter a name for it.

# Creating the Resume and posting it
While creating the resume and posting it there are eight easy and important
steps that needs to be followed without skipping anyone. The first step is to
go to the GitHub desktop and choose ‘’open in atom’’. The second step would be
unlocking index on Atom and save it as index.md. The third step would be to
create a resume in the index.md file and on the fourth step save the index.md
file again. The fifth step would be to move back to GitHub desktop. The sixth
step asked for a comment on why you made the changes. The seventh and eighth
step is to select ‘’commit to master’’ and ‘’push origin’’ respectively.

# Using Jekyll to edit your resume
In order to create predefined Jekyll themes on GitHub and making it useful for
your resume there are few steps that needs to be followed or else you can also
skip this part and wish to see the published version on GitHub pages. If you
want to do what I did then few steps needs to be followed. The first would be
to select ‘’settings’’ on your GitHub repository and move on to browsing for
GitHub pages and later choosing ‘’change theme’’ after following these steps
the second last would be to select any of the predefined Jekyll and last but
not the least refresh the page.

# Options for sources
Learning Markdown can be tough for many people as in my case it took me some
time to get it in my nerve so for better understanding and more clear knowledge
on Markdown you can also look for various other tutorials as mine is not
mandatory to watch. Apart from GitHub Atom has also been a major star of the
assignment and I was comfortable working with it while others can also look for
better alternatives for instance Visual Studio Code can also be in your list.
Overall a small enter on google can bring down the master of learning and bundle
of resources.
