# **Readme**
Acknowledging and understanding a project is conveniently done through README.
It contains instructions and material to grasp full knowledge about the project. This readme is meant to give you an overall idea of how to host and format a resume using Markdown, a Markdown editor, Github Pages, and Jekyll. The major benefit that comes with using README is it's effortless and replies to many regular queries that people will generally ask while installing and using  the project.

# Ways on presenting your Resume on GitHub Pages
To begin with, Markdown and Github was never my cup of tea and I had negligible knowledge in these fields. Those who are in a similar position like me and had zero experience in these backgrounds can relate and take notes from my assignment. The way I have hosted my assignment on GitHub pages does a basic overview of how the document needs to be portrayed for relevant understanding and how it should be done to host any write-up.

# Heading Forward
Like any other signing up process, GitHub also follows the same steps. At the very beginning a [GitHub](www.github.com) account needs to be created by your desirable email address making it more convenient by editing it with your username and securing it with a strong password to avoid any sort of hacking. After signing up you can continue downloading **GitHub desktop** on your device and easily sign in with the same email address. To get working on GitHub it has been suggested by my instructor as well as other reasonable sources to first get your hands on a good resume. Adding on it has also been specified that the resume needs to be written by using Markdown along with the help of an editor. While choosing an editor, **Atom** is my priority as it blends along smoothly with GitHub as well as contains neat live preview features making my work simpler and makes it more visible that my code is reaching along resulting to be more accommodating. After getting down with all the downloading and installation of Atom and GitHub on your desirable devices the next critical step is to learn [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). In the end, you will be set to host your resume on GitHub once Markdown is on your palms.

# Building a Repository
A Repository is a basic option we get once we sign in on our GitHub and
instructs us to create a repository. Like we do to any of our downloaded
documents on our pc, we name the file and the same goes for a repository where you enter a name for it. For instance, I have named my repository 'inanintesar.github.io'.

# Creating the Resume and posting it
While creating the resume and posting it there are eight easy and important
steps that needs to be followed without skipping anyone. The first step is to go to the GitHub desktop and choose 'open in atom'. The second step would be unlocking index on Atom and save it as index.md. The third step would be to create a resume in the index.md file and on the fourth step save the index.md file again. The fifth step would be to move back to GitHub desktop. The sixth step asked for a comment on why you made the changes. The seventh and eighth step is to select 'commit to master' and 'push origin' respectively.

# Using Jekyll to edit your resume
In order to use predefined Jekyll themes on GitHub and making it useful for
your resume, there are few steps that needs to be followed or else you can also skip this part and wish to see the published version on GitHub pages. If you want to do what I did then few steps needs to be followed. The first would be to select 'settings' on your GitHub repository and move on to browsing for GitHub pages and later choosing 'change theme' after following these steps the second last would be to select any of the predefined Jekyll. I used *Leap Day*. Last but not the least refresh the page.

# Hosting on Github Pages  
Once your Github repository is ready. Click the **Upload Files** files button and begin uploading files. You can drag one or more files from the desktop and then click **Commit Changes** to publish the file.

# More sources
Learning Markdown can be tough for many people as in my case it took me some
time to get it in my nerve so for better understanding and more clear knowledge on Markdown you can also look for various other platforms such as [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/assets/markdown-guide-sample.pdf). People should also read [Etter's Book](file:///C:/Users/inani/DownloadsModern_Technical_Writing_An_Introduction_to_Software_Documentation_by_Andrew_Etter_z-lib.org%20(2)). Apart from GitHub, Atom has also been a major star of the assignment. I was comfortable working with it while others can also look for better alternatives for instance 'Visual Studio Code' can also be in your list. I highly recommend the following [Markdown Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukJEPyKubzA) as it has been a guide to me in learning more about Markdown. Overall a small enter on google can bring down the master of learning and bundle of resources.
